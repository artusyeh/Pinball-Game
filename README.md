Devlog: ǝǝq

This project was inspired by videos of bees colliding with each other, as well as Geometry Dash. From the start, I wanted to emphasize the 
juice of the game, so I invested a lot of time into particle effects, screen shake, and smooth transitions. These touches add weight and 
impact to the collisions, which helps reinforce the chaotic, buzzing energy of a hive. To strengthen the beehive aesthetic, I expanded the 
map into two distinct sections connected by a tunnel-like structure, creating the feeling of darting in and out of hive chambers. I also 
implemented functional tunnels for the ball, adding more variety and flow to movement. While the core gameplay feels smooth and rewarding, 
there’s still room for improvement. UI contrast, particularly with the score display, needs adjustment, and additional sound effects could 
amplify immersion even further. Overall really happy with the results.
